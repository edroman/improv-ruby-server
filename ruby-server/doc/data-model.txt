Data model for Improv Game
--------------------------

User
----
first_name
email
phone
password
has_many :stories
**high_score							# personal high score across all stories made

Story
-----
has_many :users							# users of this story
**created_at : datetime					# date story was made
number : integer						# The sequential story # of this story
turn : integer							# what turn # it is (1..6)
**score : integer						# story score, as voted by users
sentence[6]								# serialized into a YAML text column
constraint[6]							# same


When user enters a game, he is shown the LAST story in the array as an indicator of the current story status in the lobby
A special rule is if you click on that story and are on sentence #2, then load the previous story first.
"Game" exists separately since:
*users can delete a game
*serves as a "join model" between User and Story
*can browse old stories in a game

** = future
